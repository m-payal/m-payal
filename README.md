## About Me: üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I am currently pursuing a Master of Computer Science at North Carolina State University, expected to graduate in May 2025. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Engineering from MKSSS Cummins College of Engineering for Women, Pune, India. My academic focus spans Software Engineering, UI/UX, Database Management, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence.


## Work Experience: üë©‚Äçüíª

In terms of work experience, I had the opportunity to work as a Web Design Intern at SupplyPoint in Durham, NC. I contributed to improving the SharePoint intranet by revamping its design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which enhanced navigation and mobile responsiveness. Additionally, I collaborated with the HR team to develop an HR ticketing system, which boosted employee engagement by 30%. My role also involved streamlining Jira project management processes, reducing task completion time by 20%.

I also worked as a Student Research Assistant at North Carolina State University, where I partnered with Dr. Ranga Raju to refine clustering and summarization techniques in NLP models. My work resulted in a 30% improvement in interpreting complex customer dialogues for Visma. I pioneered the automation of chat analysis, significantly reducing manual review time by 40% through the integration of NLP and statistical techniques.

In addition to my experience at North Carolina State University and SupplyPoint, I served as a Technology Analyst at Citibank in Pune, India. During my time there, I integrated Atlassian Jira‚Äôs REST API with Java frameworks such as Spring and Maven, which led to a 15% reduction in deployment times. I also identified inefficiencies in the CI/CD pipeline by examining Jenkins logs and restructured Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters. This improved the reliability of financial market updates by 50% and mitigated peak load challenges. My work designing a financial data modeling user interface using Python, Plotly, and matplotlib helped boost the accuracy of financial models by 35%, earning me the Citi Gratitude Performer of the Year award.

I also had the opportunity to work as a Summer Analyst Intern at Citibank in Pune, India. During this time, I optimized the traffic microservice architecture using Spring Boot, Oracle SQL, and Kafka. My efforts resulted in a doubling of daily traffic and a 50% increase in user engagement. I also utilized JUnit to ensure system scalability and performance, resulting in faster and more efficient deployments.
